The P.I.K.A.C.H.U. Pokéjob Recommender System!

For this project, let’s transport ourselves to the wonderful world of Pokémon! While we all know that Pokémon can be used for battles, there are so many other ways they can be helpful in daily life. From construction to baking to companionship, the 1008 Pokémon can help with so many tasks and problems our world faces! But with so many different options, how can you know exactly which Pokémon is right for the job? That’s where the Pokémon Interface for Knowledgable Asistance with Chosen Helpful tasks or Undertakings (P.I.K.A.C.H.U.) system can come in!


Using data from the Pokédex (thanks GameFreak for the dataset!) we can see which Pokémon is best for the input task prompt using their base stats and Pokémon descriptions. Here are some goals for the P.I.K.A.C.H.U. project:
- Recommend the best Pokémon battle matchups for an input Pokémon.

- Categorize the input prompt into a task needing one of the 6 primary stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, & Speed).

- Recognize which Pokémon type is most suited for a task (Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Fighting, Poison, Ground, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Ghost, Dark, Dragon, Steel, Fairy). Keep in mind that many Pokémon can have dual-types. For this project I will be ignoring Mega-Evolution, Terrastallized Pokémon, and other circumstances that can change a Pokémon’s type from what it is in the Pokédex

- Recognize keywords from Pokémon description that can make it well-suited for the input task. (ex: task input = taking care of injured patients. Chansey’s description: “This kindly Pokémon lays highly nutritious eggs and shares them with injured Pokémon or people.” In this case, Chansey would be one of the recommended Pokémon.)

The goal output would be a list of 5 Pokémon that can be best suited for helping with the input task. With the P.I.K.A.C.H.U., various tasks can be solved in much more efficient and effective ways!
